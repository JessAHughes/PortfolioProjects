In the Covid Project I used the data provided at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths to compare the percentage of deaths, vaccinations, and infected to the total numbers of these around the world. You can view the dashboard here at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jesse3846/viz/CovidDashboard_16574902410880/Dashboard1?publish=yes
In the Nashville Housing dataset I cleaned the data up by deleting unused columns or duplicates, unifying selling information, seperating addresses into multiple columns (Street, City, State), and reformatting the dates to be easier to use.
